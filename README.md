# symfony-forms
Investigating Symfony forms

## Notes

One must create some files containing env var values that we don't want
in source control due to the sensitive nature of the values.

* `docker/mariadb/mariadb_password_file.private`
* `docker/mariadb/mariadb_root_password_file.private`
* `docker/php/appEnvVars.private`

The MariaDB ones should contain only the password for the DB user the app users;
and the root user used to create the DB, respectively.

`appEnvVars.private` should have a `[name]=[value]` pair for the following env vars:

```bash
APP_SECRET=[any value really]
MARIADB_PASSWORD=[same as the value in mariadb_password_file.private]
DATABASE_URL=[using same MARIADB values from other settings]
```

## Building for dev

```bash
# from the root of the project

docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --detach

# verify stability
docker container ls --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
